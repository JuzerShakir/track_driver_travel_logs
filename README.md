### ‚ùó Problem Details

Each line in the input file will start with a command. There are two
possible commands.<br/>

The first command is `Driver`, which will register a new Driver.<br/>
Example: `Driver Terence`


The second command is `Trip`, which will record a trip attributed to a
driver.
<br/>
The line will be space delimited with the following fields:
the command (Trip), driver name, start time, stop time, miles driven.
Times will be given in the format of hours:minutes. We'll use a
24-hour clock and will assume that drivers never drive past midnight
(the start time will always be before the end time).<br/>
Example: `Trip Terence 07:15 07:45 17.3`


Discard any trips that average a speed of less than 5 mph or greater
than 100 mph.


Generate a report containing each driver with total miles driven and
average speed. Sort the output by most miles driven to least. Round
miles and miles per hour to the nearest integer.


#### ‚å®Ô∏è Example input:
```bash
Driver Terence
Driver Alma
Driver Adam
Trip Terence 07:15 07:45 17.3
Trip Terence 06:12 06:32 21.8
Trip Alma 12:01 13:16 42.0
```

#### üíª Expected output:
```bash
Alma: 42 miles @ 34 mph
Terence : 39 miles @ 47 mph
Adam: 0 miles
```

I have successfully solved this problem using ruby language and the solution can be found in `ver_1.rb` & `ver_2.rb` files.


The initial solution I came up with is in the file `ver_1.rb`, where I have used combination of arrays & hashes to get to the appropraite solution. Whereas, in the `ver_2.rb` file I have used only hashes, levaraging the rich methods that ruby provides.

Both soultion files achieve correct results but the main difference you will find is in the code. `ver_1.rb` uses arrays extensively and is almost impossible to follow what the code does if comments didn't exist. The updated solution, `ver_2.rb` is short and the code itself is understandable to most extent even for non-programmers.

Here's a short video where I demostrate running both solution files in terminal:

#### üíé Libraries Used
 - _time_


#### üìã Local Execution

Clone this repo, navigate to the appropraite directory and run the following commands in Terminal:

```bash
ruby ver_1.rb
```
or

```bash
ruby ver_2.rb
```

This will run the given code file. Enter appropraite input to get desired output.
